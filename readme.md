# Ecommerce Synthetic Data Generation

This project is designed to generate synthetic, but realistic, data for an electronics e-commerce retail store. The data is generated using a Jupyter notebook (`e_commerce_synthetic.ipynb`), which allows for easy modification and execution of the data generation process.

## Features

- **Realistic Customer Information**: The Faker library is used to generate realistic customer information, such as names, addresses, and phone numbers.
- **Electronics Products**: The script simulates a variety of electronics products, including TVs, smartphones, laptops, and more.
- **Order details and Other Information**: The script generates realistic orders data, including quantities, prices, and dates. Inventorylog data, and customer service data has also been generated. Reviews have been generated with the help of OpenAI's `GPT-4` Model.
